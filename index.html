          <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
          <p id="firstp">JavaScript Basics is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. javaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the odjects of these enviroments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="#"><span class="title">Variable Declaration</span></a> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values- imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be idetified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <span class="cont">var x;</span></li>
            <li><a href="#"><span class="title">Variable Assignment</span></a> Assignment operators assign values tp JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span class="cont">var x = 10;</span> </li>
            <li><a href="#"><span class="title">Data Types</span></a> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScrip primitives: Boolean - <span class="cont">true</span> or <span class="cont">.false;</span> null - <span class="cont">null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span class="cont">42</span> or <span class="cont">3.14159;</span> String - <span class="cont"> Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array = <span class="cont">[1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <span class="cont">{first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</span></li>
            <li><a href="#"><span class="title">Conditionals</span></a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: if a specified condition is true, do this code in your code block.; else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; else we execute this block of code;</li>
            <li><a href="#"><span class="title">Loops</span></a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language., but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thatsa loop!</li>
            <li><a href="#"><span class="title">Function</span></a> Functions are an encaptulation of a code block. When we call our cunction this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manualand get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.</li>
